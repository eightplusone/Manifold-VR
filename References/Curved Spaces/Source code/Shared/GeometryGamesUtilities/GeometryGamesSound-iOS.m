		//		The workaround is to break on "All Objective-C Exceptions"
		//		rather than "All Exceptions" (thus ignoring C++ exceptions).

		//		of the simulator fixes this bug, then I can go back to breaking

	//	Technical Note:  I tried funnelling PlayWAV() and PlayMIDI() into
	//	a single unified PlaySoundFile() function, which played all sounds
	//	with an AVAudioPlayer, exactly as in PlayMIDI() above.
	//	This basically worked, except that each call to PlayWAV()
	//	would block the main thread for a brief but perceptible amount of time.
	//	The web page 
	//
	//		http://www.blumtnwerx.com/blog/2009/05/adventures-in-sound-land/
	//
	//	observes that each call to [anAVAudioPlayer play] blocks the main thread
	//	for 0.04-0.05 sec, even though the sound itself plays asynchronously
	//	in a separate thread.  The problem was most noticeable in the Pool game,
	//	where the motion of the balls would hesitate slightly each time two balls
	//	collided and made a sound.  The initial break (of the pool balls) was
	//	disasterous, because it generated a great many sounds and thus a long delay.
	//	(The user doesn't hear all those sounds, because each succeeding one cancels
	//	the previous one almost immediately.)  Moral of the story:  use AudioServices,
	//	not AVAudioPlayer, for time-critical sounds.
	//
	//	Afterthought, for future reference:  If absolutely necessary, I could
	//	call [anAVAudioPlayer play] from a separate thread, but that hardly
	//	advances the present goal of simplifying the code.  So for now I'm happy
	//	to leave well enough alone, and let AudioServices play the pool sounds.
